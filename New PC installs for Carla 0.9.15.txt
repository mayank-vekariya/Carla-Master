This is what I installed on a re-built computer
to make Carla 0.9.15 work

1. Mminiconda

2. created New Env py39
conda new env: conda create --name py39 python=3.9

3.pip install stable-baselines3[extra] (got version 2.4.0 NO NEED to install gym as gymnasium comes with BS3)

4.pip install carla==0.9.15 - great news Carla works with python 3.9

5. conda install jupyter

<check: from stable_baselines3 import PPO - WORKS>

6. conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1.0
Prior to this I also downloaded CUDA 11.2 and cuDNN 8.1 from NVIDIA website and pointed to those on Path env.variable, not sure if it was necessary  

7. python -m pip install "tensorflow<2.11"

<check: from stable_baselines3 import PPO - WORKS>
<check GPU seen by tensorflow - OK
import tensorflow as tf
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))>


8. DirectX runtime from MS website
